. The purpose of this project was to create a playlist that works with Spotify's API to display a song to a user and then have that song saved to the playlist. 

. When the user types in a word, it will search up on Spotify's API song database by fetching the request and then posting it to the user. This app also have some several other features like a side-bar and a loading screen that appears before the users enters the app.
